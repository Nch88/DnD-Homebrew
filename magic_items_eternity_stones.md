## Eternity Stone of Night
*This stone has been shaped from star metal and enchanted with powerful magic. It represents the darkness of eternal night.*

The magic of this stone can be used to cast the Darkness spell 3 times per day. The darkness spills out from the stone. The spell is cast as a 7th level spell, and can only be dispelled by a spell of 7th level or higher.


## Eternity Stone of Day
*This stone has been shaped from star metal and enchanted with powerful magic. It represents the light of eternal day.*

The magic of this stone can be used to cast the Light spell 3 times per day. The light spills out from the stone. The spell is cast as a 7th level spell, and can only be dispelled by a spell of 7th level or higher.


## Eternity Stone Seal
*When the Eternity Stones are combined, they have the power to seal something away for eternity.*

You can use the Eternity Stone Seal to cast the Arcane Lock spell. When cast this way the effect can only be dispelled or suppressed by using a 9th level spell slot. You can chose to select no creatures who can open the object normally, not even yourself.

When you cast the spell you press the Eternity Stone Seal into the object, where it creates a rhombus shaped indent. You can then remove the stone.

To dispell or temporarily dismiss the spell, you need to insert the Eternity Stone Seal into the indent again.

The magic of the stone only allows it to have one seal active at a time. Trying to create a second seal while one is active will fail.
