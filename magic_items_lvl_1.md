## Elven Wailing Blade

*Wailing blades are extremely rare. They are created by binding the spirit of a Banshee into the material of the blade, a feat only the most skilled craftsmen and mages are capable of. In addition, it is only done if the elves encounter a Banshee that threatens the innocent, but still deserves to do penance for its acts in life. You can unleash the Banshee's wail in various forms when wielding this blade.*

This weapon is magical and requires attunement.

Once per short rest you can cast the cantrip Booming Blade as a level 1 player.

Once per long rest you can cast Shatter as a level 2 spell. The DC to save against the spell is 12.


## Elven Bow of Thorns

*These weapons are grown more than crafted, by using magic and ancient words from the elven language to coerce a living plant into growing in the shape of a bow. The magic infused in the wood gives the bows some unique properties.*

This weapon is magical and requires attunement.

Once per short rest you can cast the Thorn Whip cantrip as a level 1 player. You can make a normal ranged attack roll to hit, and if you do the spell deals your normal attack damage to the target in addition to its other effects.

Once per long rest you can cast the Entangle spell. The DC to save against the spell is 12.


## Boots of Acceleration

*These boots must surely be the result of some experiment gone wrong... But maybe they can be of use under the right circumstances.*

Requires attunement.

You can activate the magic of these boots as a bonus action. When you do so they allow you to accelerate at an outrageous rate, preventing enemies from making opportunity attacks against you until the end of your turn. In addition, enemies cannot target you with ranged attacks until the start of your next turn.

The first time in the day you use the boots, their magic protects you from the forces affecting your body, but as the magical energy fades subsequent uses become more dangerous. The second time you use them you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. Each use hereafter increases the DC by 5.
