## Scarab of Mists

*This penchant is carved in the likeness of a scarab, and enchanted to provide a boon to anyone wielding it around their neck.*

This item requires attunement.

It starts with 1d4 charges and regains a charge at dawn every day.

You can spend a charge to cast the Gaseous Form spell on yourself without expending material components.

If the bearer of this penchant takes damage that would knock them unconscious, but not outright kill them, the magic imbued in this item will protect them from further harm. Instead of dropping to 0 hit points, the bearer instead drops to 1, and is turned into a swirling mist as per the Gaseous Form spell. This consumes all charges from the item.
