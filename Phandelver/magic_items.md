## Scarab of Mists

*This talisman is carved in the likeness of a scarab and you can see swirling mist inside it, when it is charged. It is enchanted to provide a boon to anyone wielding it around their neck. When activated, swirling mists flow from the eyes of the scarab to envelop the bearer.*

This item requires attunement.

It starts with 1d4 charges and regains a charge at dawn every day.

You can spend a charge to cast the Gaseous Form spell on yourself without expending material components. When the spell is cast from this item it does not require Concentration, but can still be dismissed as a free action.

If the bearer of this penchant takes damage that would knock them unconscious, but not outright kill them, the magic imbued in this item will protect them from further harm. Instead of dropping to 0 hit points, the bearer instead drops to 1, and is turned into a swirling mist as per the Gaseous Form spell. This consumes all charges from the item.

When the last charge is used, roll a d20. On a 1, the scarab shatters when the gaseous form spell ends.

## Necklace of Enhanced Aggression

*This necklace is a string of teeth filed to fine points. During combat, when you need an extra kick of adrenaline, the teeth will bore into your flesh, the pain granting you increased ferocity.*

---

This item requires attunement.

You can use your bonus action to make a single attack. When you do so you take damage equal to your proficiency bonus. This damage cannot be prevented.

## Goggles of Light Enhancement

*A famous gnome once invented these goggles for his human friend to help him see in the dark. Unfortunately, the moment the human put them on for the first time the gnome's assistant ignited a magnesium strip close by, and the resulting flare, enhanced by the goggles, burned out the human's eyes. Use with caution.*

---

While wearing these goggles you have darkvision out to 60 ft. You also have bright light sensitivity. This works like sunlight sensitivity, except for all sources of bright light.

## Amulet of Alchemical Genius

*This amulet is made of 5 small vials of acid hanging from a golden chain. Thin vapor drifts upwards from the vials, forcing the wielder to inhale them.*

*WARNING, might cause reduced sense of smell, irritation of the eyes, and mild cases of insanity and hallucination.*

This item requires attunement.

While wearing this item you know the Acid Splash cantrip, if you do not already know it. You also know the Acidbolt cantrip, which works like the Firebolt cantrip, except it deals acid damage.

---

*Alchemical visions:*

When casting an illusion spell with a visual element, you can infuse the illusion with acidic vapor. When a creature interacts with the illusion, e.g. to investigate whether it is real, it tage 1d6 + 2 times the level of the spell acid damage. After taking the damage, the creature has advantage to determine that the illusion is not real.

## Manual of the Magnificent Feint

*This manual was written by a true master of swordsmanship and deception. By moving in very precise ways you are able to fool your opponent and deliver a quick strike behind their guard. But mastering the move is difficult, and if your oppenent reads your intent, you might leave yourself vurnerable.*

---

To learn the manoeuvre, you must study the manual and practise the poses it describes. You can spend an hour doing this, during which you make an Acrobatics check and a Performance check, both with a DC of 20. If you fail, you can keep trying and you lower the DC for both checks by 3 each time. If you succeed you gain the following ability.

As a bonus action you can attempt to perform the Magnificent Feint against an opponent. Make a Performance check against a DC of 10 + the creature's CR, or its passive Insight, whichever is higher. If you succeed, you can make a single attack against the creature. If you fail, the creature gets advantage on its next attack against you before your next turn.
