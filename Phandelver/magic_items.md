## Scarab of Mists

*This penchant is carved in the likeness of a scarab and you can see swirling mist inside it, when it is charged. It is enchanted to provide a boon to anyone wielding it around their neck.*

---

This item requires attunement.

It starts with 1d4 charges and regains a charge at dawn every day.

You can spend a charge to cast the Gaseous Form spell on yourself without expending material components.

If the bearer of this penchant takes damage that would knock them unconscious, but not outright kill them, the magic imbued in this item will protect them from further harm. Instead of dropping to 0 hit points, the bearer instead drops to 1, and is turned into a swirling mist as per the Gaseous Form spell. This consumes all charges from the item.

When the last charge is used, roll a d20. On a 1, the scarab shatters when the gaseous form spell ends.

## Necklace of Enhanced Aggression

*This necklace is a string of teeth filed to fine points. During combat, when you need an extra kick of adrenaline, the teeth will bore into your flesh, the pain driving you to increased feats of strength.*

This item requires attunement.

You can use your bonus action to make a single attack. When you do so you take damage equal to your proficiency bonus. This damage cannot be prevented.

## Goggles of Light Enhancement

*A famous gnome once invented these goggles for his human friend to help him see in the dark. Unfortunately, the moment the human put them on for the first time the gnome's assistant ignited a magnesium strip close by, and the resulting flare, enhanced by the goggles, but out the human's eyes. Use with caution.*

While wearing these goggles you have darkvision out to 60 ft. You also have bright light sensitivity. This works like sunlight sensitivity, except for all sources of bright light.

## Amulet of Alchemical Genius

*This amulet is made of 5 small vials of acid hanging from a golden chain. Thin vapor drifts upwards from the vials, forcing the wielder to inhale them.*

*WARNING, might cause reduced sense of smell, irritation of the eyes, and mild cases of insanity.*

This item requires attunement.

While wearing this item you know the Acid Splash cantrip, if you do not already know it. You also know the Acidbolt cantrip, which works like the Firebolt cantrip, except it deals acid damage.

*Alchemical visions:*

When casting an illusion spell with a visual element, you can infuse the illusion with acidic vapor. When a creature interacts with the illusion, e.g. to investigate whether it is real, it tage 1d6 + 2 times the level of the spell acid damage. After taking the damage, the creature has advantage to determine that the illusion is not real.
